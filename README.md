# Possible BUG FIX
If you get error running the code that says you have problem with chrome_options -
The solution is to open cmd and write the next lines:
##### pip uninstall selenium
##### pip install selenium
------------------------------
##### *** NOTE: when you uninstall selenium and it requests you to approve the process - hit enter or y/Y keys.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
Youtube will delete the views after 1 day sadly. 
It is possible to increase the view time of the videos so Youtube won't be so agressive.
Anyways, it is a good chance to use the time-limited views to gain real views, subscribers and activity.
Enjoy! :)
